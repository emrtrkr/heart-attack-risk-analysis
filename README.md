Heart Attack Prediction Model
This project involves a machine learning model for predicting the risk of heart attack. The model is built using decision trees and random forest algorithms.

Installation

You can use the following command to clone project files:
git clone https://github.com/emrtrkr/heart-attack-risk-analysis.git

Usage

After cloning the project files, you can open the heart-attack-risk-analysis .ipynb Jupyter Notebook file in the main directory and run the model. You can also run the model using Python files.
python prediction.py

Data Set
